A <i class=“def-ital\">monologue</i> is a speech for one person; a <i class=“def-ital\">monocle</i> is an eyeglass worn in one eye only. The <i class=“def-ital\">ton</i> part of the word comes from the word <i class=“def-ital\">tone</i>. Something that is MONOTONOUS has only one tone; it doesn’t vary at all, and therefore it is boring and uninteresting. </p><p>“The scenery was rather MONOTONOUS; there was nothing but cornfields as far as you could see.” </p><p>“The book was impressive at first, but after a while its heavy style became rather MONOTONOUS.” </p><p>“She quickly became bored with the MONOTONOUS work on the assembly line in the factory.” </p><p>Other forms of the word: MONOTONY, n.</p>"
